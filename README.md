# bootstrap-portfolio

## Intro:
Hi! Thanks for stopping by! I'm currently working on a new portfolio for myself using bootstrap.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Docker

## Goal
This is to make a comparison to bootstrap and react.

I'll be making two separate repositories for a react version and a bootstrap version.

## Final Thoughts
Final Thoughts will go here once both sites are completed.
